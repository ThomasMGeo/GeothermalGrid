# GeothermalGrid
Small, notebook based repository to grid and  explore various geothermal datasets and products. 

# Python Packages Used

Pandas, Xarray, Verde, Matplotlib, SciPy, Numpy

## Data sets

SMU Data [here](http://geothermal.smu.edu/static/DownloadFilesButtonPage.htm)

USGS Gridded Data [here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/63090a9cd34e3b967a8c19c4)

Gravity data [here](https://mrdata.usgs.gov/gravity/)

Dataset need: BHT's for all of California would help (Salton Sea is a big hole!)

Any other machine-readable Geothermal datasets would be great. 

# Papers of interest
This list is not exhaustive, but some of these papers either discuss datasets used or other factors.
